# User Guide Overview

Welcome to the Octopi User Guide! This comprehensive tutorial series will take you from raw tomogram data to precise particle coordinates using deep learning-based 3D particle picking.

## Tutorial Sections

### 🏷️ [Prepare Labels](labels.md)
**Create training targets from particle annotations**

Learn how to convert particle coordinates into 3D training masks. This section covers:

- Automated target generation from data portal annotations
- Manual specification for custom datasets
- Quality control and validation techniques
- Multi-class segmentation preparation

**When to use:** Start here after importing your data to prepare training materials.

### 🧠 [Training](training.md)
**Train 3D U-Net models with Bayesian optimization**

Master both single model training and automated architecture exploration:

- Model exploration with Bayesian optimization (recommended)
- Single model training for specific use cases
- MLflow experiment tracking and monitoring
- Best practices for resource management

**When to use:** After preparing training labels, use this to develop your particle picking models.

### 🔮 [Inference and Localization](inference.md)
**Apply trained models to generate predictions and extract particle coordinates**

Deploy your trained models to analyze new tomograms:
- Segmentation mask generation
- Peak detection and particle extraction
- Performance evaluation against ground truth

**When to use:** Once you have trained models, use this to get final particle coordinates.
